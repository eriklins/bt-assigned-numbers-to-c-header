# Convert BT Assigned Numbers into a C Header File
This Python script grabs the BT Assigned Numbers for
- Service UUIDs
- Characteristic UUIDs
- Descriptor UUIDs
- Company IDs
- GAP Appearance

and creates a C/C++ header file from it, which can then be used in own BT C/C++ application like [BLE Scout](https://github.com/eriklins/BLE-Scout).
